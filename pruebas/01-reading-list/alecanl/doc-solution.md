## Objective
_What and why are we doing this?_

_Include context for people that are unfamiliar with the project._

_Keep it short, elaborate below in **Background, Overview and Detailed Design**_

_Add screenshots / mocks where necessary_

## Goals
1. [✅] **Display of Available Books**: The application should display a list of available books that the user can check.

2. [] **Creation of Reading List**: The user should be able to create a reading list from the available books. In the UI it should be clear which books are in the reading list and which are not. It should also be possible to move a book from the reading list to the available list.

3. [] **Book Filtering by Genre**: Users should be able to filter the list of available books by genre, and a counter will be displayed with the number of available books, the number of books in the reading list and the number of available books in the selected genre.

4. [] **Status Synchronization**: There should be a global status synchronization reflecting the number of books in the reading list and the number of books still available. If a book is moved from the available list to the reading list, the count of both should be updated accordingly.

5. [] **Data persistence**: The application must persist the reading list data in the browser's local storage. On page reload, the reading list must be maintained.

6. [] **Synchronization between tabs**: If the user opens the application in two different tabs, the changes made in one tab must be reflected in the other. No need to use Backend.

7. [] **Deployment**: The application must be deployed on a free hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, etc) and must be accessible through a public URL. Indicate the URL in the README.

8. [] **Test**: The application must have AT LEAST one test. Make the test that you consider most important for your application.
